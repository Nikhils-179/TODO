Statement : A TODO Application stores information about the three task : Title and Description of the activity

Approach : Work on a framework which will take web api calls from frontend and store it in database
           Protocol to be used : HTTP
           Language used : GO
           Web Framework : GIN

Description:

Used GIN package and create endpoints of the http calls (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
USED ORM Technique which is " Technique that allows developers to work with relational databases
using object oriented paradigm "
It defines Sql queries / way to provide database interaction

Same objective I have used by importing necesaary sql packages in TODO Yellow and driver but at the actual usage we use :
"gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
"gorm.io/gorm"

IN TODO_GREEN Windows user might get issue while running the program as CG0_ENABLED .... , To fix the issue download gcc complier and run.
